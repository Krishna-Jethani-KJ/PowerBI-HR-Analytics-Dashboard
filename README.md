Data Sources
The dataset for this project was simulated to reflect real-world HR scenarios and includes:

Employee Demographics (age, gender, marital status, etc.)
Employment Information (departments, job roles, tenure)
Performance Metrics (evaluation scores, work output)
Attrition Data (reason, length of service, demographic impact)
Data Preparation & Loading
Data Import: Loaded CSV files into Power BI and inspected them for data quality.
Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized column formats.
Transformations: Filtered and transformed fields to ensure data consistency.
Data Modeling
Relationships: Established relationships between tables (e.g., Employees, Departments, Performance).
Date Dimension: Added a custom Date dimension table to support time-based analysis.
Calculated Columns & Measures: Created DAX measures for insights, including:
Employee Tenure
Attrition Rate
Performance Rating
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Power BI, initial exploratory analysis was conducted to understand high-level HR trends:

**Hiring Trends: Explored changes in hiring rates over time.**
Department Analysis: Analyzed attrition and hiring trends across departments.
Demographics: Examined the impact of age, gender, and marital status on attrition.
Dashboard Design & Development
Attrition Analysis: Visualized factors affecting employee attrition, including tenure, department, and demographics.
Performance Tracker: Developed a custom performance tracker to monitor individual and departmental performance.
User-Friendly Design: Optimized the layout with a cohesive color scheme, branded fonts, and clear navigation.

**Insights & Findings**
Key insights from the data include:

High Attrition Among Early Tenure Employees: A significant percentage of attrition occurs within the first year.
Demographic Impact: Age and marital status have noticeable effects on employee retention.
Performance Correlation: High performers are less likely to leave, emphasizing the need for targeted retention strategies.


**Conclusion**
This Power BI dashboard allows Atlas Labs to proactively manage employee attrition, understand workforce demographics, and monitor performance. By leveraging data analytics, Atlas Labs can make informed decisions to improve employee retention and enhance overall HR effectiveness.
